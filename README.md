# FuZe Chrome Extension - (automatic zoom link opener)

## Description
Developed for the NwHacks hackathon, FuZe attempts to automate a mundane problem that plagues university student and office worker alike in the pandemic era - forgetting to open a zoom link.

## Features

### New Tab Page
With our extension comes a redesigned new tab page! Developed using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript, this simple yet effective page minimizes distractions that may hinder, in order to bring to focus what really matters. By automatically opening Zoom links at each of their corresponding times, this page ensures that no Zoom meeting will be missed.

### Zoom Popup
Our intuitive Zoom Popup page completely removes the hassle of frantically searching for a zoom link on Canvas right before the start of class. One can simply fill in the form on the popup, add all of their Zoom links for the semester, and have them appear in an organized table on their new tab page, where they can be easily accessed.
